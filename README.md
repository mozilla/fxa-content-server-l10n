fxa-content-server-l10n
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/fxa-content-server-l10n.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/fxa-content-server-l10n)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/fxa-content-server-l10n/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/fxa-content-server-l10n/tree/master)

This repo (abbreviated as "L10N" in this README) contains all translated/translatable strings for the fxa-content-server repo (abbreviated as "SOURCE"). It contains an exact copy of the locales/ directory from SOURCE, and nothing else (except for this README).

The moz-verbatim translation team works with this L10N repo, pushing changes into it any time they like.

On a regular basis, somebody on the SOURCE committers team copies everything from L10N into SOURCE/locale/, reviews the changes, then commits and pushes SOURCE. This makes the new translated strings available to SOURCE users, provides a clean (single-commit) revision history, and prevents non-locale/ changes from leaking from one repo to the other. The SOURCE repo contains a script (scripts/import_locale) to perform this update.

On a (different) regular basis, a SOURCE committer will update in the other direction. This starts with running the SOURCE repo's grunt "l10n-extract" task, which updates the *.pot files in SOURCE. The committer then copies the *.pot files from SOURCE into a checkout of L10N. Then they run ./scripts/merge_po.sh in L10N, which updates the *.po files in L10N. Then they should commit and push to L10N. That will update the set of translatable strings for the l10n team to work on.

## Dependencies

* Install [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).
OS X: 
```
brew install gettext
brew link gettext --force # brew does not link the tools into /usr/local. Force the link.
```

Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install gettext`

The process to work with strings:

* Make sure you installed the dependencies and `msgfilter` (from `gettext`) command is available in your shell.
* Have the `fxa-auth-server` and `fxa-content-server` repos at the same directory level as `fxa-content-server-l10n`.
* Have all the dependencies be up to date in the fxa-auth-server and fxa-content-server repos using `npm install`.

## Locale Normalization
> Before Release Build

Some locales need to be copied over into a different directory. Run this script a few hours before the production deploy:

```
./scripts/before_prod_deploy.sh --l10n-repo .
```

## String extraction
> After Production Deploy

Source strings are extracted from the [fxa-content-server](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/) and [fxa-auth-server](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/) repos. Make sure you to `git pull` the latest changes from `master` for both of those repositories.

* `cd` into this project directory and run:
```
./scripts/extract_strings.sh --mailer-repo ../fxa-auth-server --content-repo ../fxa-content-server --l10n-repo . TRAIN_NUMBER
```
where `TRAIN_NUMBER` is the train you are cutting strings for.

This will create a new branch. Now run:
```
./scripts/before_prod_deploy.sh --l10n-repo .
```

Git commit the changes made by the script. Pull request that branch against `master`.

After that pull request is merged run:

```
./scripts/email-dev-l10n.sh
```

The script above will generate an email for the l10n mailing list. Read through the instructions in the script output to post to the l10n mailing list.
